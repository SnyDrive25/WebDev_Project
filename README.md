# Share_it project


<h1>Manual user</h1>
<br/>
In this app there are a total of 6 pages you can interact with. 
<br/>
First of all, let's talk about the first page you see when you launch the app : the Login.
<br/>
<br/>


<h3>LOGIN</h3>
<br/>

<br/>
The login is very basic and intuitive. If you already possess an account, you just need to type your pseudonym and your password and login yourself !
<br/> 
If you don't have an account, no worries, you just have to click on the register button to create an account.
<br/>
<br/>


<h3>REGISTER</h3>
<br/>

<br/>
Here is basically the same as the login except for the fact that you also need to give a mail address to create your account.
<br/>
After your registration, you will be redirected to the login where you just need to repeat the first step.
