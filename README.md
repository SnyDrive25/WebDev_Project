## User Manual
In this app there are a total of 6 pages you can interact with. 

First of all, let's talk about the first page you see when you launch the app : the Login.

### User Login Page

The login is very basic and intuitive. If you already possess an account, you just need to type your pseudonym and your password and login yourself !

If you don't have an account, no worries, you just have to click on the register button to create an account.

### User Registration Page

Here is basically the same as the login except for the fact that you also need to give a mail address to create your account.

After your registration, you will be redirected to the login where you just need to repeat the first step.

## Code Explanation
For this app we decided to use react.js because it perfectly matched our project and is easy to use.

This app contains a front end with the visuals and a back end with the data processing and storing.

### Front

The front is a bunch of pages and components with one single form sheet.
All of them are javascript files but use HTML to construct the web page and the form sheet is in CSS.
